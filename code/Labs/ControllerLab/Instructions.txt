1) Create a REST Controller to serve Customer resources.

For this lab, you will need to have a Tomcat 9 server installed on your
machine.  Talk to your instructor if you need help with this.

You have a working Spring application with Customer, CustomerDAO
and CustomerServices classes.  You also have a Spring Config file.
You are allowed to change/replace any and all of the above if you want.

Your job is to write a Controller which will allow
for the following:
	- Getting all Customers
	- Getting a Customer by Id
	- Getting a Customer by name
	- Creating a new Customer
	- Deleting a Customer by Id
	- Updating a Customer
	- For extra credit, implement partial update.

You will have to make sure that the configuration in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
matches your application.

Look in the file for comments starting with TODO for clues.



2) For now, test your controller using a web based REST Client.

We will cover Unit/Integration testing and Mock objects later in the course.
